# Tic Tac Toe Game with WebSockets

</div>

This is a simple multiplayer **Tic Tac Toe** game developed using **WebSockets** in **Golang** for the server-side logic and **HTML**, **JavaScript** for the front-end interface.

The game allows two players to join a match, make their moves, and play in real-time using WebSockets for communication between the client and server. This project demonstrates basic usage of **WebSockets** to implement real-time multiplayer functionality.
